Grab the bugs. One person advocate for each one. They prepare
 * What the problem and fix was

Three types of bug:
 * Implementation defect
 * Incorrect specification
 * Missing specification

For each:
 * Problem: What was the problem?
 * Fix: What was the fix?
 * Lessons: What lessons were learned?
 * Classification: Is it an implementation, incorrect spec or missing spec issue?
 * Cause: What was the root cause?
 * Actions: How could we prevent this happening again?

Classification:
 * Are we losing money? -> Critical: House on fire - drop what you are doing
 * Can it be lived with? -> Improvement - backlog
 * Is it new functionality? -> Feature - backlog
 * Is it broken? -> Finish WIP, do next
