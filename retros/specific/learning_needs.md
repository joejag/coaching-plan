(solo) What does the team need from me
(pair) What practices do I, our could I use to meet those needs.

(triads) Plot how visible each practice is to the team needs (everyone can, some can, someone in the org can, no one can) (write a number on each card - Capability Red style)

(solo) Think about what practice you'd like to improve in - write it on an index card
(pair) Discuss how you might go about improving in that practice - write ideas on the back of the card
(all) Share the one thing you want to improve in and how you are going to do it - the rest of the room says how they can support that person
