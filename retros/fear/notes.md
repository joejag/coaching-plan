RULES

It's ok to pass: If weird or uncomfortable, it's ok to be an observer

INTRO

Starter: Show 5 cards. Fist of five, how many of these sympthoms have you seen.

INFO

Fear cripples information flow. No sharing, no learning, just fix and hide it.
Only in geneartive culture will things be shared.
Fear is an innovation killer: Amagalya hack. Fight/Flight/Freeze -> caused by fear. Flight->They quit

GAME

Fear in the workplace:
2 sets of cards: Classify and little monsters (fears and symptoms of fear): Cards against hummanity

Person who picked card decides the best match

Classify cards have a lot of text, related to fear or fear culture
Have a conversation. (about 10 minutes for the game)

So, how was it?
Did you recognise the symptoms, or have you heard someone say things like it in your workplace?

INFO

We want to get to a fearless workplace (new Amy Edmunson book) -> Move from culture of fear to safe fearless workplace
"Pyschological safety exists when people feel their workplace is an environment where they can:
* speak up
* offer ideas
* ask questions
without fear of being punished or embarrassed" -> Amy Edmunson definition of psych safety

Fear is like a disease, it travels. You can do something about it!

"How you manage your own fear will either calm things down or further rev things up" -> Harriet Lerner "The dance of fear"
WHO has eradication strategies, we can do the same for our workplaces
It involces individuals, teams and leadership

GAME / INFO

Take second deck. Notice the three categories: self, team, leadership (leaderhsip can be anybody, but easier if higher up in the org, but leaders can also use influence to get things understood or done)
Speaking about feelings is hard - but practicing helps (happiness histogram 0-5, feelings cards as a metaphor, story cubes)
Increase conversation frequency -> personal maps -> moves to working agreements (personal maps with a lie added - guess the lie) -> create team norms
Simple rules -> check in 0-5
Cards are good as it's external, you can point to it, build vocab and do something about it
Psych Safety mesaures (red, green, yellow like spotify squad health check) -> show aggregated data rather than individual. Aggregate over teams.

GAME

Choose the top three fears in your organisation, however you want to.
Make a mini-kanban and disucss each one for five minutes and find safety enchancers to deal with those fears or make them less painful
Choose a card for each level: solo, team, leadership
What is the easiet one to start with? Imagine you have the problem in your teams
You are creating our fear eradication strategy
