## Understand the direction

"A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at" ~ Bruce Lee

Create vision of how work works in the ideal state (process vision - not biz).

Toyota examples: Zero defects, 100% value adding, 1 piece flow, no injuries

## Grap the current condition



# Coaching bit

1. Try to understand how the leaner is thinking (coach observes)

* What do you think about this problem?
* Take this blank sheet of paper and write your ideas down here
* Learner says: I see it this way, we should do this 

2. Compare this to the desired pattern (coach judges)

* Compare how the learner thinks to the desired pattern of the improvement kata

3. Introduce course correction (instructing or guiding)

* Adjust course if necessary
