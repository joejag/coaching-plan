What's the benefit of TDD?

Do you know about RGR?

Do you know about the two schools of thought on TDD?

Chicago:
 * You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
* You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
* You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

Tests are specific examples, Code are rules. Move forward towards the general solution

Demo (FizzBuzz? LeapYear?)
 * Fake it > Obvious > Trangulation (crossing the river stepping on stones, don't jump!)
 * TestNames are business, not technical
 * Fine to have multiple asserts, as long as we are testing one behaviour
 * Say whether you think a test will fail
 * Duplication (three times and it is out)
 * refactor (80% better readability, 20% for design)
