### Question

## What are the benefits of pair programming?

---

# Fundamentals

---

## Three fundamentals

* Avoiding tiredness
* Styles
* Adapting to experience levels

---

# Avoiding Tiredness

---

## Avoiding Tiredness

* Small break every 45 minutes
* Water
* Good night's sleep
* Caffeine

---

# Four Common Styles

---

## Driver-Navigator

Like a car trip

* Driver is tactical
* Navigator is strategic

Switch on time or task

---

## Strong Style

*“For an idea to go from your head into the computer it MUST go through someone else’s hands”*

* Navigator: Say what to do, keep a to-do list
* Driver: Push back, ask questions, improvise

---

## Strong Style

*“For an idea to go from your head into the computer it MUST go through someone else’s hands”*

* Navigator speaks: Intent -> Location -> Details
* Switch on time, task or idea

---

## Tour guide

* Driver is doing strategic and tactical thinking
* Driver says everything they are doing
* Navigator asks questions

---

## Ping-Pong

Great if you can TDD the problem

1. Person 1 writes a failing test.
2. Person 2 makes it pass.
3. Person 2 writes a failing test.
4. Person 1 makes it pass.

# Expertise

---

## Expertise

Differs by

* Tech stack (e.g. Java, JavaScript)
* Domain knowledge (e.g. Shared Plots, Mapping)
* Codebase

---

# Asymmetric power dynamics

---

## Asymmetric power dynamics

Need to be neutralised by the person on the<br/> upward side

  * Senior vs Junior, CS degree vs other or no degree
  * Gender, Age, Race, Nationality, Native Language
  * Editor choice, Developer vs Tester

*Take more cues from your pair, interrupt less, <br/>catch your reactions*

<!--

We've been told to ignore race and gender. Bad advice

-->

---

# Exercise time!

---

## Exercise

* Matching styles with experience levels
* Expert & Expert, Expert & Novice, Novice & Novice

*(in pairs)*

---

## Activity

* Make a diagram to help remind you of the pairing styles and when to use them

*(on your own)*

### Question

## When have you not enjoyed pairing?

## Can you compensate for that?

---

# Patterns and <br/>Anti-Patterns

---

## Program Out Loud

Why is this a good pattern?

---

## Allowing a checked-out navigator

Why is this an anti-pattern?

---

# Exercise time!

---

## Exercise

* Choose two patterns and anti-patterns
* Prepare reasons for why they are useful or compensating measures if not
* Be ready to present back

*(in pairs)*

---

## Activity

* Summarise two good and bad patterns you've heard on your index card

*(on your own)*

### Question

## What sort of things should a navigator be saying?

---

# Communication

## How to run a pairing session

---

## Pairing Template

1. Agree on the high-level goal out loud
1. Break the work into a handful of tasks and prioritize them
1. Decide your driver/navigator swapping strategy
1. Eliminate distractions
1. Work
1. Analyze the session with a mini retro

---

## Agree on the high-level goal out loud

* Have a brief chat about the goal
* *Why: This clears up any confusion before you go into the details*

---

## Break the work into a handful of tasks and prioritize them

* Break the goal into smaller steps and make them visible
* *Why: Makes things less intimidating, easy to add additional tasks*

---

## Decide your driver/navigator swapping strategy

* It can be worth setting a 25-minute timer and using Driver-Navigator at first
* *Why: Stops one person driving for too long*

---

## Eliminate distractions

* Silence your phone, disable notifications on the machine, minimise social apps
* *Why: Shows respect for your pair and the work you are about to do*

---

## Work

* Do the work!
* Take breaks, swap roles, do the simplest thing that can work

---

## Analyze the session with a mini retro

* What went well? What could improve things by 1% next time?
 * Did distractions sneak in?
 * Were there long stretches of no talking?
 * Did the session feel like a grind at any point?
 * Did you split the work up well?
 * Was your end-product high-quality?

---

# Exercise time!

---

## Exercise

* Read over the pairing practices sheet
* Pair with someone, follow the template and exhibit the behaviours
* When the timer goes, have a mini-retro and check which behaviours you exhibited

*(in pairs)*

---

## Make a plan for how you can pair next week
