# Plan

* Title: Effective Git
* Learning Outcome: Be able to explain git concepts, get out of trouble and know how to appropriately work with a team

## Anatomy of a repo

* Connection (pair): Discuss: "what else have you used for VCS?", "Why do we use Git?", "Why does staging exist?"
* Practice (pair): git practical: diff, merge+fast-forward, cleaning branches, staging, pull
* Conclusion (solo): Draw the anatomy on an index card

## When things to wrong

* Connection (pair): Discuss your stories of getting stuck
* Practice (pair): git practical: undo changes, conflicts
* Conclusion (triad): 1 fact you've learned

## Working with others

* Connection (triads): Draw how changes happen in your teams repo
* Practice (group): Discussio about styles of git: master, feature branch, gitflow
* Conclusion (solo -> group): Write three facts on back of index card, share one at the end

# Tips

* cherry-pick
* setting up your env (email, username, editor)
* rebase vs merge
* multi origins
* stash
* Big file destruction
* Merge requests aren't part of Git
