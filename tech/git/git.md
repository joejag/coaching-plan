# Plan

* Title: Effective Git
* Learning Outcome: Be able to explain git concepts, get out of trouble and know how to appropriately work with a team
 
## Anatomy of a repo

* Connection (table): Discuss: "what else have you used for VCS?", "Why do we use Git?", "Why does staging exist?"
* Practice (pair): git practical: diff, merge+fast-forward, cleaning branches, staging, pull
* Conclusion (solo): Draw the anatomy on an index card

## When things to wrong 

* Connection (pair): Discuss: your stories of getting stuck
* Practice (pair): git practical: undo changes, conflicts
* Conclusion (four): One fact you've learned

## Rebase vs Merge

* Connection (pair): Discuss: Do you usually use merge or rebase? Why?
* Practice (pair): git practical: Rebase, pull, pull-rebase, branch conflicts (merge), branch conflicts (rebase)
* Conclusion (triad): Show to each other how rebase and merge works in LEGO (one each). Do you think you should rebase pushed commits?

## Working with others

* Connection (triad): Draw how changes happen in your teams repo
* Practice (group): Discussion about styles of git: master, feature branch, gitflow
* Conclusion (solo -> group): Write three facts on back of index card, share one at the end
