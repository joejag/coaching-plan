# Part 2

* Use this script to create repositories for each step: http://bit.do/basegit
* For help: https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules

## 1. Escaping bad situations (6 short exercises)

* Make a typo in a commit message and fix it
* Make a commit, then add a file to it
* Delete a local commit, then retrieve it with reflog
* Commit to master (don't push), then realise it should've gone to a feature branch
* Commit to the wrong branch and fix it by putting it on another (hint: with stash)
* Commit to the wrong branch and fix it by putting it on another (hint: with cherry-pick)

## 2. Undo changes

* Make changes for three commits
* Undo changes from second commit
* Send commits to remote
* Undo changes from one of the pushed commits (hint: using revert)
