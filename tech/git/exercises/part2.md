# Part 2

## Escaping a bad situation

* Make a typo in a commit message and fix it
* Make a commit, then add a file to it
* Delete a local commit, then retrieve it with reflog
* Commit to master (don't push), then realise it should've gone to a feature branch
* Commit to the wrong branch and fix it by putting it on another (hint: use stash)
* Commit to the wrong branch and fix it by putting it on another (hint: use cherry-pick)

## Undo changes

* Create local branch
* Make changes for three commits
* Undo changes from second commit
* Send commits to remote
* Undo changes from one of the push commits (without using force)
