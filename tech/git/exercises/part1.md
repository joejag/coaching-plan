# Part 1

* Use this script to create repositories for each step: http://bit.do/basegit
* For help: https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules

## 1. Differences

* Add a file and commit it to the local repository
* Change the contents of the file in the working directory
* See the diff
* Add the file to the staging area
* See the diff
* Change the contents of the file in the working directory
* Get the list of changes (look at `git status`). What's happened?

## 2. Cleaning branches

* In the same repo
* Create branch A (and send to remote)
* Create branch B off `master` (and send to remote)
* Create branch C off `master` (and send to remote)
* Look at what branches are available locally and remotely
* Delete branch A only in local
* Delete branch B only in remote
* Delete branch C in local and remote

## 3. Staging multiple commits

* In the same repo
* Change an existing file
* Create a new file
* Make two commits for each change

## Bonus: Check out git internals

* Look in the `.git` directory and figure out what things are for
