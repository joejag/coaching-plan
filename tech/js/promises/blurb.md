Javascript is a single-threaded language, but it runs inside a browser or node runtime which gives it special async powers.
Historically the way we used these powers was via callbacks, but the language creators have never been entirely happy enough with how they performed in the real world. Over the last five years, we've gone from callbacks to promises to async/await. 

But why even use callbacks? Why use async/await? What's this single-threaded stuff about anyway?

In this workshop, you'll experience first hand how using these different programming styles gives you advantages over the other. We'll be watching a great talk on the event loop, then tackling problems in pairs using VS Live Share to experience these coding styles together.

Together, you will escape callback hell!
