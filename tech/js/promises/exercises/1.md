# 1. Blocking

Have a try at using this site which simulates what happens when you do heavy work that blocks the event loop:

http://rauschma.github.io/async-examples/blocking.html

How have they managed to simulate the blocking behaviour?

# 2. Timeouts

What do you think is the output of this code?

```js
console.log('Hello World')
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log('I am in the timeout function')
}, 0)
console.log('I am outside of the timeout')
```

Try it and see.

# 3. Calling code

Now we are going to see the traditional way to do async stuff in Javascript.

Add this block of code into a new file:

```js
function printString (string) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(string)
  }, Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1)
}
```

Create a function that calls this three times with 'A', 'B' then 'C'.

Does the output go in alphabetical order?

# 4. Calling code with a callback

Now let's change the method to include a callback

```js
function printString (string, callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(string)
    callback()
  }, Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1)
}
```

Imagine we wanted the output to be in strict order of A, B, C.

Change your code to use the callback to guarantee output order.
