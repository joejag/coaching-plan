# 1. Timeouts

What do you think is the output of this code?

```
console.log("Hello World");
setTimeOut(function(){
  console.log("I am in the timeout function")
}, 0)
console.log("I am outside of the timeout");
```

Try it and see.

# 2. Calling code

Now we are going to see the traditional way to do async stuff in Javascript.

Add this block of code into a new file:

```
function printString(string){
  setTimeout(
    () => {
      console.log(string)
    },
    Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1
  )
}
```

Create a function that calls this three times with 'A', 'B' then 'C'.

Does the output go in order?

# 3. Calling code with a callback

Now let's change the the method to include a callback)

```
function printString(string, callback){
  setTimeout(
    () => {
      console.log(string)
      callback()
    },
    Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1
  )
}
```

Imagine we really wanted the output to be in strict order of A, B, C.

Change your code to use the callback to guarantee ouput order.
