## Content

- Goal: Create maintainable tests that give you high confidence that your components work. Allow you to refactor implementation without changing behaviour.
- The more the test resembles how the code is used, the more you trust it
- It is not a test runner, or part of jest. It is a library

- Principles:

  - Deal with Dom nodes, not components
  - Interact the way a user will (first try to find buttons, text on screen, then accessibility, then add an 'id')

- Super short example

- Show cheat sheet and go over items (https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/cheatsheet)
