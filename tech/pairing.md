* Code Review sucks after the task is done

# What is it?

A disciplined apporach to writing software.
Each person has a role and responsibility.
Must have an explicit way of switching and taking breaks.

Shortening feedback loop. Easier to change in realtime.

Caution: Requires maturity from peers

Important: Pairing is a choice, not enforced

Caution: If in position of power. Your responsible for making the session enjoyable. Do not use your position to impose decisions or make your pair uncomfortable.

Tip: Do not mention a typo for at least 10 seconds. Their editor will show them and it breaks their flow.

## How does it help?

* Real time code-review
* Brings folk together
* Discipline of staying on task

## Roles

Take turns being navigator and driver.

Driver: codes, types, moves mouse
Navigator: Reviews, big picture, asks questions. Thinks how does this code fit in? Where will this code lead? Can we design this better?

## Switching

You want an equal time on both roles.

* Ping Pong

“Is my pair engaged?” or “Am I engaged with my pair?”

Always ok to ask to drive. Don't zone out or check email, take a shared break if needed

They may struggle. This is just familiarity, not intelligence. You may not get much done in the first few hours.

Sit together with shared access to monitors, not one behind the other.

## Breaks

Pairing is more tiring then working on your own as you are coding and communicating. 

sustainable pace is key.

Pomodoro. Decide work to be done. Set timer for 25m. Take 5m break. repeat three more times, take 20m break.

Sand timer. Break every 45m.

## Is it productive?

* Less likely to get blocked or distracted by social media
* Simpler code as it had to be explained
* Less bugs if folk are thinking about things
* Spreads knowledge
* Faster onboarding of new people
* Less debugging and testing later

## Why isn't everyone doing it?

* Need to get over the discomfort. Tram analogy where it is half full, where do you sit?
* Easier to sit on your own and blame others
* Folk will see your weaknesses. Remain polite.
* Bad experiences, ask and see if you can overcome.

## How long to pair?

* End of story, end of week

## Introducing it

* One afternoon a week, one day.
* Be open about tooling

It's learning about: langauge, company, coworker, project, or just pairing in general. It's not about shipping more code, it's about better code and products.

## questions

* Do you need to program to pair? No!

* Why you are pairing? What’s the goal?
* What tools and techniques do you suggest the pairs use?
* How/When will pairing and matchmaking happen?
