* 1. Make the list of anyone with a vested interest in your product
 * individual or group of individuals
 * High level and low level
 * Might only talk to them sometimes

e.g. SDT, other dev teams, users, support staff, top leaders, legal, audit, budget?

  * Whose investment/permission do you need, to proceed?
  * Whose process approval do you need, to comply?
  * Whose resources do you need to deliver change/action?
  * Whose engagement do you need, to do the work?
  * Whose expectations do you need to meet, to succeed?
  * Whose cooperation do you need, in order for it to work?
  * Who thinks they are affected (but aren’t) & needs reassurance?

* 2. Ask questions about the list
  * Who has a financial interest (add an £)? Who gives us more budget for people?
  * Who has an emotional interest (add a :))? (their baby)
  * For each stakeholder: what are their motivations
  * Who are your biggest supports (add a :thumbs-up)?
  * Who are your biggest nay-sayers (add a mark)? (careful in contact)

* 3. Map it out
  * Shows level of engagement you have with them
  * Y-Axis: Interest of stakeholder (affected by outcome - how bothered are they?)
  * X-Axis: Influence of stakeholder (power in changing direction or environment)
