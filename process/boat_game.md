# Advice from Ray

Nature of work is complex - waiting, jumps around effieciency is measured by individuals Do we have an opportunity to change it? This is simple version of reality,

Are we busy working or is the work working? How do ou feel when you did that? Ask after each environment. This is what is feels like when everyone.

very clear, time as shown. for the timer

get as much wip as possible. hurray them. check for shortcuts

# Klaus Version

* Intro 
  * We are an awesome boat-building company, and we're going to make a ton of money - just look at this stack of orders!  We work in a production-line system to build up each boat over a number of steps.  I'm going to show you each a step, so that you can work as a team to build these boats, and help me to become a very rich man

* Round 0: Learn to build a boat
  * Show each person step by step. One fold each until the end
  * Get timer person to start timer and record when a boat arrives 
  
* Round 1: Push no limits
  * Policies: Push, no limits on the queues, FIFO
  * Pause at 2 mins (take WIP measurement, put on board)
  * Keep going until all done  
  * Say: 
    * 3.2.1. FASTER! That's great. Faster. Great.
    * "People are working. I am earning money"
    * "20 seconds left, then we pause"
    * Just a pause, keep workign as before 
    * "Don't worry too much about quality. Quality is good but we want to make money"
    *  in real life you won't have stopped working. Plenty of orders out there 
    * Applause!
    * Push ships onto the floor


* Round 2: Pull, WIP of 1
  * Polices: pull system, must be pulled, no queues, WIP of 1, put up your hands
  * Pause at 2 mins (take WIP measurement)
  * Keep going until all done  
  * Say:
    * WIP. What does this mean? We limit every activity to ONE
    * Everything else is the same, we still want to go fast. I want to earn money"
    * No need to slow down, we are still working fast"
    * Trail run 
    * Countdown. We start in 3.2.1
    * "That's pull" "hands in the air, that's great"
    * "Yeah, that's pull now". "Still working fast, that's great" "Don't slow down please or we don't get the measurements" "3.2.1. And stop!"
    * What do you think the WIP is? 
    * "I'm bankrupted now, you guys aren't working enough"
    * "I could've earnt a Â£100k and you guys are sitting around with your hands in the air. Are you crazy?"
    * what was the difference between the first and second rounds?"


* Thoughput Review
  * Ask:
    * Calculate the average ships per minute. How?
    * Timer: how many in the first minute
    * I'm going to cross out the first number. Why?
    * I'm going to cross out the last number why?
    * Let's do the pull version
    * KT: It's the same
    * "Here you are always working, here you are sitting around with your hands in the air. And we are earning hte same amount of money. Why?"
    * 2nd time you weren't working all the time. "What could we do with this slack time?" "What could be an improvement?
  * KT: The bottleneck constrains the system
  * KT: You had slack to improve throughput - no point starting new work - go help the bottleneck
  * KT: In real world we'd install a buffer before the bottleneck, feed it until full then empty again
  * KT: Last person is an expert. Does 5SPM. Even if another could do 1SPM it's going to increase throughput

* Lead Time Review
  * "We've also captured another metric which is the lead time. Lead time is the time we start working on it until it reaches here (the end)".
  * Ask: When did the last boat take in both systems? -> Calc lead time 
  * "What does this mean?"
  * KT: 2nd time we keep WIP outside the system, so whatever we do gets done fast
* Lead Time Questions
  * What if we started working on the last ship at 15 minutes?
    * System 1: Takes longer and longer
    * System 2: Exactly the same again 
    * System 1 thoughts: No point estimating, time depends on WIP and the system being stable (draw lines)

* Expedites
  * Priority ship introduced
    * If introduced after 10m, it'd take 40m (What's wrong with you! I can do this in 2 minutes!)
    * What do we do to get it done faster? (LIFO)
    * What happens to the red ship? what happens to the white ones?
    * What if you have 4 red ships? And the white lead time?
    * What happens when they all become red ships?
    * KT: You must limit red ships -> otherwise you cannot guarantee time
    * KT: Making P1s works for a while, then you need P1+

* Changing Requirements
  * 1st system, we want green ships instead of red. 
    * What do we do? Throw them away
  * 2nd system, it's still in the pile (point to pile of paper for effect)
  * KT: Commit late as possible. Customer can change mind. Options rather than commitmenets, but do commitmenets as fast as possible

* Teams and Systems Thinking
  * What if you weren't individuals but teams? What if the teams at the start working faster?
  * If we want to start with a Kanban where should we start? The bottleneck - anywhere else makes things worse
  * What if we have a team bonus system?
  * KT: No motivation to help the bottlenck
  * KT: When you have slack you should work to improve the system

* Little's Law
  * Lead time = WIP / Throughput
  * Plug in numbers from exercise at 2 mins. They should be the same
  * Decrease WIP to reduce lead time. Don't let work enter the system
  * What else could we do? Increase throughput. Usually involves hiring new staff or improving. Decreasing WIP is easier and cheaper
