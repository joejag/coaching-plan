This session introduces how we do this with ActonableAgile. Looking into

- The three principles of metrics
- Cycle Time
- Throughput
- Flow Efficiency
- Aged Work in Progress
- Forecasting without estimates

It'd be good to discuss as a team:

* Is it worth keeping Jira up to date once a day? 
* Do you want aged items to be highlighted at standups?
* Is there any experiment we want to run?

# Three princes

* Metrics should be used by the team 
  * they are the start of conversations
  * they require context
  * Keep them inside the team, or folk start comparing
  * productivity is hard to measure and you are better off measuring outcomes 

* Metrics need to be surrounded by conversation
  * Not in email threads, they are part of a story

* Metrics should be used as part of a specific investigation or experiment
  * There are loads of decent metrics to capture, but getting them all is overwhelming
  * Ideally come out of a retro. Are we slower now? 

# How we get data into ActionableAgile

https://github.com/ActionableAgile/jira-to-analytics

# Throughput

* "How many in a week?"
* Super easy to measure, hard to game without making smaller stories.
* Number of stories completed in a sprint finished in

Show:

* Throughput

# Cycle Time

* "How fast is one story"
* How long from "3 Amigos" to "Done"
* Includes waiting time, blocked time
* You want to be reducing this

Show:

* CycleTime Scatterplot
* CycleTime Histogram

# Flow Efficiency

* Ratio between value adding time and cycle time.
* Waiting or Blocked
* Average in industry is 15%. Chris mapped one of the intake streams at 2   %.

Show:

* Flow Efficiency
* Heat Map

# Aged Work in Progress

* Look how stories are doing compared to ones in the past
* Some stories are within normal parameters

Show

* Aged work in progress

# Monte Carlo: Forecasting

* Estimating when you get something has long been a pain in project management
* Folk want precise dates
* Use statistics. KPI is throughput
* Uses random sampling of stories from random days. After 10k it's usually right
