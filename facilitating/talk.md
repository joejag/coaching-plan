# PART ONE!

## Connection: What do learners spend most of their time on during your training programs?

1. Easy for you, bad for learners. Reading is the least effective way of learning for most people
2. Folks don't remember most of what they hear. Strong auditory learners may benefit but most won't. Listening doens't mean learning, despite how entertaining it is.
3. Better. If has images, videos. Image rich is easier to remember
4. Discussion dramatically increases learning. Remember and use information for longer time
5. When learners teach each other the increase their own confidence, competerance and master what they learned.

## Concept

### Trainer's train; learners listen

- Domimant paradigm.

- ASK: Why do we do this?

- It's nothing to do with learning, it's to do with econmics of delivering training.
- Folk expect it (since kids), companies expect it, it's easier for the trainer, trainers are SMEs
  - Only one way to do: talking
  - Easy to evaluate: Did you tell them about X?
  - It takes less time to deliver a lecture then to engage learners, less resources and less physical space.

### Content-Focused -> Learner-Focused

- Take time to find out what learners know
- Use a variety of active learning strategies to involve learners
- Create an inviting, friendly, informal learning environment

## Exercise Answers

O: 3,6,8.9 Not 1,2,4,7,5

# PART TWO!

## Concept

Connect as soon as they enter the room
Do the "what you'll learn bit after, not first"

- 2/3rds talking rule
- Activity - imagine you lost your voice, but still had to get them to learn. How would you do it?

## Concrete Practice

Write a connection - to see what they know already
Write concepts they need to know
Write exercises to actively try those concepts - quiz! exercise! poster!
Write a conclusion - to summarise their learning - quick, three things, explain to the person next to you

## Learning outcome - active

- Perform the five core refactorings
- Explain the companies objectives for the next year
