bbr# What do learners spend most of their time on during your training programs?

1. Reading the text, handouts, slides or manuals
1. Listening to you
1. Watching visuals on slides or screens
1. Discussing concepts or practicing skills
1. Teaching each other and learning from each other

## Trainers train; learners listen

![](./images/lecturing.jpg)

---

## Why do we do this?

![](./images/lecturing.jpg)

---

> "The brain research from the past two decades proves that human beings learn best when they are actively involved in the learning process – experiencing a variety of meaningful, motivating, self directed learning methods in an informal, hands-on learning environment"

## Shift the paradigm

_Trainers_ **talk**; _learners_ **listen**

->

When _learners_ **talk** and **teach**, they learn

---

## Which do you prefer?

_"Let's begin by brainstorming at least a half-dozen facts you already know about this topic"_

vs

_"I'm going to begin by telling you what you are going to learn about this topic"_

---

# Exercise _(in fours)_

Group by **effective** and **ineffective**. Choose between:

- **Effective openings**: _Link learners to learners, and learners to the topic_
- **Effective practices**: _Have learners do an active skills practice or active review of content_

# Effective Openings

### Link learners to learners, and learners to the topic

---

## O1. The trainer begins by stating their background, experience and credentials

### O6. Learners write the learning outcomes on a note-taking page, then check off the ones they consider important. Each tells another person what they checked, and then refers to the page again at the end of the training to review what was learned

# Teach Back _(in pairs)_

- One person talks, the other listens
- After one minute switch roles

## Explain why you should make brain friendly learning?

# Discussion <br/>_(at your table)_

## How do you design your training workshops?

---

> We are not, cannot be, about designing content. A fundamental perspective I want you to take away is that we are designing experiences

# The 4Cs

![](./images/4cs.png)

---

# The 4 Cs

- Connections _(share what they already know)_
- Concepts _(direct instruction)_
- Concrete Practice _(active practice)_
- Conclusions _(summarise learning)_

---

# Exercise<br /> _(in pairs)_

## Write up your next workshop using 4Cs

# Learning Outcomes

**Action Word (observable behavior) + Concept/Skill**

- Bad: _know / understand / learn_
- Good: _demonstrate / explain / list / define <br/>show / apply / use / act / solve <br/> do / discuss / perform_

---

![](./images/c2.jpg)

---

# Concepts

**direct instruction**

Learners take in new information in multisensory ways: hearing, seeing, discussing, writing, reflecting, imagining,
participating, and teaching it to others

---

![](./images/c3.jpg)

---

# Concrete Practice

**active practice**

Learners actively practice a skill using the new information, or they participate in an in depth, active review of what they have learned.

---

![](./images/c4.jpg)

---

# Conclusion

**summarise learning**

Learners summarize what they have learned, evaluate it, celebrate it, and create action plans for how they plan to use it after the class is over.

---

![](./images/c5.jpg)

---

# Connection

**share what they already know**

Learners make connections with what they already know or think they know about the topic, with what they will learn or want to learn, with each other, and with the instructor.

---

# Activity _(fours)_

### Share your instructional design with a neighbouring pair

![right](./images/share.webp)

---

# Activity<br /> _(solo)_

### Write down five things you've learned on an index card

### **You have one minute**

# **Thank You!**
