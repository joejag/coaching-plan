# Shift the paradigm

## Connection: What do learners spend most of their time on during your training programs?

1. Easy for you, bad for learners. Reading is the least effective way of learning for most people
2. Folks don't remember most of what they hear. Strong auditory learners may benefit but most won't. Listening doens't mean learning, despite how entertaining it is.
3. Better. If has images, videos. Image rich is easier to remember
4. Discussion dramatically increases learning. Remember and use information for longer time
5. When learners teach each other the increase their own confidence, competerance and master what they learned.

## Concept

### Trainer's train; learners listen

* Domimant paradigm. Folk expect it (since kids), companies expect it, it's easier for the trainer, trainers are SMEs
* It's nothing to do with learning, it's to do with econmics of delivering training.
  * Only one way to do: talking
  * Easy to evaluate: Did you tell them about X?
  * It takes less time to deliver a lecture then to engage learners, less resources and less physical space. 

### Brain Friendly learning

"Boring and effective are mutually exclusive attributes in learning. you can't be effective if your training is boring" Michael Allen - 2005

When have you been in a brain friendly training?

 * You learnt for the sheer joy of it. You learnt by doing it.  You felt accomlishment after leraning it. You taught someone else.
 * Collaboration was encourged, competition de-emphasied, mistakes were neccesary part of the exercise.

### Content-Focused -> Learner-Focused

The brain research from the past two decades proves that human beings learn best when they are actively involved in the learning process – experiencing a variety of meaningful, motivating, selfdirected learning methods in an informal, hands-on learning environment.

* Use a variety of active learning strategies to involve learners
* Create an inviting, friendly, informal learning environment
* Take time to find out what learners know

### Phrases - from Page 34

Collaborative, participatory and inclusive.

## Concrete Practice: (4s)

### Best or Worst - from Page 164 OR Openings from Page 87

## Conclusion: Explain the difference between content focused vs learner focused training

Pairs, 1 minutes, switch

## Connection

Pairs, question: How do you design your training workshops?

## Concept

"We are not, cannot be, about designing content. A fundamental perspective I want you to take away is that we are designing experiences" - Clark Quinn - Engaging Learning (2005)

* 2/3rds rule.
* What if you couldn't speak?

## Concrete Practice

Write title + learning outcome
Write concepts they need to know
Write exercises to actively try those concepts - quiz! exercise! poster!
Write a conclusion - to summarise their learning - quick, three things, explain to the person next to you
Write a connection - to see what they know already

## Learning outcome - active

* Perform the five core refactorings
* Explain the companies objectives for the next year

## Exercise: Create a workshop

* Concept: Lecture segment, but keep it multisensory
* Concrete Exercise: Active practice or review
* Conclusion: Summarize
* Connection: Not icebreakers. What they know or think they know

## Conclusion

Write down five things you've learned in one minute on an index card

# Random notes

* What are the first ideas that come to your mind when you think of the words “instructional design?
* easier, quicker, and more effective ways to create fun and memorable learning experiences
* learner focused, rather than trainer-focused (it's how learners learn, not how trainers train)

# 4Cs

Connections: During the opening of the training, learners make connections with what they already know about the training topic, with what they will learn or want to learn, with each other, and with the trainer.
 * Learners make connections with what they already know or think they know about the topic, with what they will learn or want to learn, with each other, and with the instructor.
 * What they know or think they know - not icebreakers (little to do with the topic)
 
Concepts: During the lecture-segment of the training, learners take in new information in multisensory ways: hearing, seeing, discussing, writing, reflecting, imagining, participating, and teaching it to others.
 * Learners take in new information in multisensory ways: hearing, seeing, discussing, writing, reflecting, imagining,
participating, and teaching it to others
 * Direct instruction

Concrete Practice: After the lecture, learners actively practice a skill using the new information, or they participate in an in depth, active review of what they have learned.
 * Learners actively practice a skill using the new information, or they participate in an active review of what they have learned.
 * Active practice

Conclusions: At the closing of the training, learners summarize what they have learned, evaluate it, celebrate it, and create action plans for how they will use what they have learned.
 * Learners summarize what they have learned, evaluate it, celebrate it, and create action plans for how they plan to use it after the class is over.
 * Learners sumarise

At no time do learners just sit and listen for long stretches without any active engagement.

Learning Outcomes: What will they be able to 'do' after the training?
Action Word (observable behavior) + Concept/Skill = Learning Outcome. Not “know, understand, learn”
Observable: “demonstrate, explain, list, define, show, apply, use, act, solve, do, discuss,
perform,”

2 thirds of the time it's the participants talking. Measure it

Paradigm shift - when the underlying beliefs change - "Trainers talk, learners listen".
 * It's make content easier to deliver
 * Easy to evaluate (were they told how X works?)

content-focused -> learner-focused

Connect as soon as they enter the room

Do the "what you'll learn bit after, not first"

Activity - imagine you lost your voice, but still had to get them to learn. How would you do it?

Only ask questions with multiple right answers
