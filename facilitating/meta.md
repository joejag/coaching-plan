* What are the first ideas that come to your mind when you think of the words “instructional design?
* easier, quicker, and more effective ways to create fun and memorable learning experiences
* learner focused, rather than trainer-focused (it's how learners learn, not how trainers train)

Connections: During the opening of the training, learners make connections with what they already know about the training topic, with what they will learn or want to learn, with each other, and with the trainer.
 * Learners make connections with what they already know or think they know about the topic, with what they will learn or want to learn, with each other, and with the instructor.
 * What they know or think they know - not icebreakers (little to do with the topic)
 
Concepts: During the lecture-segment of the training, learners take in new information in multisensory ways: hearing, seeing, discussing, writing, reflecting, imagining, participating, and teaching it to others.
 * Learners take in new information in multisensory ways: hearing, seeing, discussing, writing, reflecting, imagining,
participating, and teaching it to others
 * Direct instruction

Concrete Practice: After the lecture, learners actively practice a skill using the new information, or they participate in an in depth, active review of what they have learned.
 * Learners actively practice a skill using the new information, or they participate in an active review of what they have learned.
 * Active practice

Conclusions: At the closing of the training, learners summarize what they have learned, evaluate it, celebrate it, and create action plans for how they will use what they have learned.
 * Learners summarize what they have learned, evaluate it, celebrate it, and create action plans for how they plan to use it after the class is over.
 * Learners sumarise

At no time do learners just sit and listen for long stretches without any active engagement.

Learning Outcomes: What will they be able to 'do' after the training?
Action Word (observable behavior) + Concept/Skill = Learning Outcome. Not “know, understand, learn”
Observable: “demonstrate, explain, list, define, show, apply, use, act, solve, do, discuss,
perform,”

2 thirds of the time it's the participants talking. Measure it

Paradigm shift - when the underlying beliefs change - "Trainers talk, learners listen".
 * It's make content easier to deliver
 * Easy to evaluate (were they told how X works?)

content-focused -> learner-focused

Do the "what you'll learn bit after, not first"

Activity - imagine you lost your voice, but still had to get them to learn. How would you do it?

Only ask questions with multiple right answers
