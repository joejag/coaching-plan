# Six Trumps: The Brain Science That Makes Training Stick.

# Review
  
  * Put learning in 10-20 minute chunks
  * Review after each chunk in small groups (facts, quiz), encourage writing
  * Add imagery to help things stick. Anacdotes help
  * Don't present from one location, move about

# Six principles

* Movement trumps sitting: 
  * WHY: Lack of oxygen, moving boosts brain power 
    * Talking, moving, at least every 15 minutes 
   
* Talking trumps listening: 
  * WHY: Learning is social, we learn best by teaching 
  * in pairs, triads, table groups or whole room have short (every 1 minute) conversations
  * Example exercises
    * Turn to the person next to you and tell them one fact that you didn't know before
    * Tell 2 people near you, 3 facts that you didn't know before
    * Take 2 minutes to discuss the implication for this info
    * Ask a quiz question to someone near
  
* Images trump words:
  * WHY: Mental images are easier to remember (metaphor, images)
    * Gather photos, stories, videos, metatphors, case studies, job stories
    * Produce a takeaway sheet
    * Get participants to draw a visualtisation of what they are learning
    * Collect anecdotes  

* Writing trumps reading:
  * WHY: Uses whole brain, can't do anything else. Multi-sensory activity. You process info twice
    * Give attendees a minute to write a short summary down. An opinion, quiz question
    * Notes can be post-it, index card, posters

* Shorter trumps longer:
  * WHY: Easier to remember in chunks. Like phone numbers.
    * Put learning into 10-20 minute chunks, then have a review session (move, write, talk)

* Different trumps same:
  * WHY: Brains ignore things that are the same. New grabs our attention
    * Change things regularly, instructor method, learner activities, environment.
    * Move around the room
    * Add relevant emotional pieces, stories, photos, jokes, videos
